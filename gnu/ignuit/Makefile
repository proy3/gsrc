DESCRIPTION = Memorization aid based on Leitner flashcards
define BLURB
Ignuit is a tool for aiding in the memorization of new information
based on the Leitner flashcard system.  In this system, new cards are
studied with decreasing frequency as they grow older, unless you
encounter difficulty memorizing them, after which you encounter them
more often.  Cards can include embedded audio, images and
mathematical formulae and a card collection can be exported to
several formats.
