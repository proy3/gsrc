DESCRIPTION = Binary utilities: bfd gas gprof ld

GNU Binutils is a collection of tools for working with binary files.
Perhaps the most notable are "ld", a linker, and "as", an assembler.
Other tools include programs to display binary profiling
information, list the strings in a binary file,
and utilities for working with archives.  The "bfd" library for
working with executable and object formats is also included.
