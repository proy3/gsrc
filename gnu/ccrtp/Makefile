DESCRIPTION = Implementation of RTP (real-time transport protocol)
define BLURB
GNU ccRTP is an implementation of RTP, the real-time transport protocol
from the IETF.  It is suitable both for high capacity servers and
personal client applications.  It is flexible in its design, allowing
it to function as a framework for the framework, rather than just
being a packet-manipulation library.
