NAME = The GNU C Library
GARNAME = libc
UPSTREAMNAME = glibc
GARVERSION = 2.20
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/
DESCRIPTION = C library
define BLURB
The GNU C Library is the standard C library of the GNU system.  It
defines the system calls and other basic functionality necessary to
write programs in the C language.  It handles low-level functionality
that communicates with the kernel, such as process and file
management, as well as higher-level functionality such as string
manipulation or command-line argument handling.
