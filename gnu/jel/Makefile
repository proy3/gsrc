NAME = JEL
GARNAME = jel
GARVERSION = 2.0.1
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/jel/
DESCRIPTION = Java expression library and compiler
define BLURB
GNU JEL is a library that lets a program accept user-defined expressions
to be entered and evaluated at runtime.  In fact, the expressions are
compiled by JEL to Java bytecode to avoid the performance penalty of
adding interpreted expressions to an already-interpreted language.
