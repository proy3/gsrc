DESCRIPTION = Standalone C++ class framework for manipulating audio data
define BLURB
GNU ccAudio2 is a portable C++ class for working with audio data from
disk.  The classes are both endian and content aware; rather than
treating audio as binary data, this library treats it as an sequence
of samples.  It can also handle metadata information.  ccAudio2
supports sun audio, raw samples, and RIFF encoded audio data.
