DESCRIPTION = Statistical analysis of economic data (econometrics)
define BLURB
GNU Gretl is a package for performing statistical computations for
econometrics.  It consists of both a command-line client and a
graphical client.  It features a variety of estimators such as
least-squares and maximum likelihood; several time series methods such
as ARIMA and GARCH; limited dependent variables such as logit,
probit and tobit; and a powerful scripting language.  It can output
models as LaTeX files.  It also may be linked to
GNU R and GNU Octave for further data analysis.
