DESCRIPTION = Finding text and HTML files that match boolean expressions
define BLURB
GNU Bool is a utility to perform text searches on files using Boolean
expressions.  For example, a search for "hello AND world" would
return a file containing the phrase "Hello, world!".  It supports
both AND and OR statements, as well as the NEAR statement to search
for the occurrence of words in close proximity to each other.  It
handles context gracefully, accounting for new lines and paragraph
changes.  It also has robust support for parsing HTML files.
