DESCRIPTION = Extensible file matching and filtering
define BLURB
GNU combine works to merge files based on a common key in a hash table.
It can be seen as similar to, albeit much more powerful than, the
standard "join" utility.  Unlike "join", any number of files
may be merged based on the matches found.  combine also has other
advanced features, such as date parsing and directory traversal.
