DESCRIPTION = Play the game of Go
define BLURB
GNU Go is a program that plays the game of Go, in which players place
stones on a grid to form territory or capture other stones.  While it
can be played directly from the terminal, rendered in ASCII
characters, it is also possible to play GNU Go with 3rd party
graphical interfaces or even in Emacs.  It supports the standard
game storage format (SGF, Smart Game Format) and inter-process
communication format (GMP, Go Modem Protocol).
