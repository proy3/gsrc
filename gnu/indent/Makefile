GARVERSION = 2.2.10

DESCRIPTION = Code reformatter
define BLURB
Indent is a program that makes source code easier to read by
reformatting it in a consistent style.  It can change the style to
one of several different styles such as GNU, BSD or K&R.  It has some
flexibility to deal with incomplete or malformed syntax.  GNU indent
offers several extensions over the standard utility.
