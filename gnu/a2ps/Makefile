DESCRIPTION = Any file to PostScript, including pretty-printing
define BLURB
GNU a2ps converts almost anything to a PostScript file, ready for
printing. It accomplishes this by being able to delegate files to
external handlers, such as Groff and Gzip.  It handles as many steps
as is necessary to produce a pretty-printed file.  It also includes
some extra abilities for special cases, such as pretty-printing
"--help" output.
