DESCRIPTION = The GNU Bourne-Again SHell
define BLURB
Bash is the shell, or command-line interpreter, of the GNU system.  It
is compatible with the Bourne Shell, but it also integrates useful
features from the Korn Shell and the C Shell and new improvements of
its own.  It allows command-line editing, unlimited command history,
shell functions and aliases, and job control while still allowing
most sh scripts to be run without modification.
