DESCRIPTION = Managing installed software packages
define BLURB
GNU Stow is a symlink manager.  It generates symlinks to directories of
data and makes them appear to be merged into the same directory.  It
is typically used for managing software packages installed from source,
by letting you install them apart in distinct directories and then
create symlinks to the files in a common directory such as
/usr/local.
