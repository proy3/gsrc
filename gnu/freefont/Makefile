DESCRIPTION = Unicode-encoded outline fonts
define BLURB
GNU FreeFont is a collection of scalable outline fonts that are
suitable for general computer use and for desktop publishing. A
serif, a sans serif and a monospace font are included, all available in both
TrueType and OpenType formats.  The fonts support a broad
range of characters for many different writing systems, and have
excellent coverage of mathematical notation.
