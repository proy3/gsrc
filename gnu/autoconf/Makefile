NAME = Autoconf
GARNAME = autoconf
GARVERSION = 2.69
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
DESCRIPTION = Create source code configuration scripts
define BLURB
Autoconf offers the developer a robust set of M4 macros which expand
into shell code to test the features of Unix-like systems and to
adapt automatically their software package to these systems.  The
resulting shell scripts are self-contained and portable, freeing the
user from needing to know anything about Autoconf or M4.
