AutoGen is a program to ease the maintenance of programs that contain
large amounts of repetitive text.  It automates the construction of
these sections of the code, simplifying the task of keeping the
text in sync.  It also includes an
add-on package called AutoOpts, which is specialized for the
maintenance and documentation of program options.
