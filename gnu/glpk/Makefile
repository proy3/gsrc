NAME = GNU Linear Programming Kit
GARNAME = glpk
GARVERSION = 4.55
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/
DESCRIPTION = GNU Linear Programming Kit, supporting the MathProg language
define BLURB
GLPK is a C library for solving large-scale linear programming (LP),
mixed integer programming (MIP), and other related problems.  It
supports the GNU MathProg modeling language, a subset of the AMPL
language, and features a translator for the language.  In addition to
the C library, a stand-alone LP/MIP solver is included in the
package.
