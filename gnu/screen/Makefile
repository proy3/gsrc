DESCRIPTION = Full-screen window manager providing multiple terminals
define BLURB
GNU Screen is a terminal window manager that multiplexes a single
terminal between several processes.  The virtual terminals each
provide features such as a scroll-back buffer and a copy-and-paste
mechanism.  Screen then manages the different virtual terminals,
allowing you to easily switch between them, to detach them from the
current session, or even splitting the view to show two terminals at
once.
