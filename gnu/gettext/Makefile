DESCRIPTION = Tools and documentation for translation
define BLURB
GNU Gettext is a package providing a framework
for translating the textual output of programs into multiple
languages.  It provides translators with the means to create message
catalogs, as well as an Emacs mode to work with them, and a runtime
library to load translated messages from the catalogs.  Nearly all GNU
packages use Gettext.
