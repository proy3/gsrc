DESCRIPTION = Line-oriented text editor
define BLURB
Ed is a line-oriented text editor: rather than offering an overview
of a document, ed performs editing one line at a time.  It can be
executed both interactively and via shell scripts.  Its method of
command input allows complex tasks to be performed in an automated way.
GNU ed offers several extensions over the standard utility.
