DESCRIPTION = An extended whois client in Java
define BLURB
GNU jwhois is a client for the WHOIS protocol, which allows you to query
the owner of a domain name.  The program uses an extensible
configuration file to determine the most appropriate server to query
and, upon success displays the result to the user, otherwise it can
optionally redirect the query to another server.
