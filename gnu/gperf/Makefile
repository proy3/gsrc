DESCRIPTION = Perfect hash function generator
define BLURB
gperf is a perfect hash function generator.  For a given list of
strings, it produces a hash function and hash table in C or C++ code.
That the hash function is perfect means that no collisions can exist
and that look-ups can be made by single string comparisons.
