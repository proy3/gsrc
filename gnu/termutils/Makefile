DESCRIPTION = The tput and tabs utilities for terminal operations
define BLURB
The GNU Termutils package contains two programs, "tput" and
"tabs".  "tput" is used in shell scripts to manipulate the terminal
display, for example by clearing it or moving the cursor to a specific
point, centering text or underlining text.  "tabs" is used to specify
and set hardware tab stops on terminals that support it.
