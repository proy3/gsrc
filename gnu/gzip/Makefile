NAME = Gzip
GARNAME = gzip
GARVERSION = 1.6
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/
DESCRIPTION = General file (de)compression (using lzw)
define BLURB
GNU Gzip provides data compression and decompression utilities;
the typical extension is ".gz".  Unlike the "zip" format, it
compresses a single file; as a result, it is often used in conjunction
with "tar", resulting in ".tar.gz" or ".tgz", etc.
