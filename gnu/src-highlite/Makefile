NAME = Source-highlight
GARNAME = src-highlite
UPSTREAMNAME = source-highlight
GARVERSION = 3.1.7
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/
DESCRIPTION = Produce a document with syntax highlighting from a source file
define BLURB
GNU source-highlight reads in a source code file and produces an output
file in which the keywords are highlighted in different colors to
designate their syntactic role.  It supports over 150 different
languages and it can output to 8 different formats, including HTML,
LaTeX and ODF.  It can also output to ANSI color escape sequences,
so that highlighted source code can be seen in a terminal.
