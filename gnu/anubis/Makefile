DESCRIPTION = SMTP message submission daemon
define BLURB
Anubis is a daemon that sits between the Mail User Agent (MUA) and
the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).  When a mail is sent by a user in the
MUA, it is first passed to Anubis, which performs additional
processing to the message before passing it on for delivery by the
MTA.  Anubis may, for example, modify the message headers or body, or
encrypt or sign the message.
