GARVERSION = 4.1.0

DESCRIPTION = GNU problem report and bug management system
define BLURB
GNATS is a set of tools for tracking bugs and other user-reported
software issues.  It is completely open-ended in how its database may
be queried, edited and maintained, featuring interfaces ranging from
the command-line to Emacs, though the main means of interaction is
via its web interface.  It is also flexible enough to support
user-made utilities.
