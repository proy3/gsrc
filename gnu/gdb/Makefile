DESCRIPTION = The GNU debugger
define BLURB
GDB is the GNU debugger.  With it, you can monitor what a program is
doing while it runs or what it was doing just before a crash.  It
allows you to specify the runtime conditions, to define breakpoints,
and to change how the program is running to try to fix bugs.  It can
be used to debug programs written in C, C++, Ada, Objective-C, Pascal
and more.
