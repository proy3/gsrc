DESCRIPTION = Comparing and merging files
define BLURB
GNU Diffutils is a package containing tools for finding the
differences between files.  The "diff" command is used to show how two
files differ, while "cmp" shows the offsets and line numbers where they
differ.  "diff3" allows you to compare three files.  Finally, "sdiff"
offers an interactive means to merge two files.
