GNU TeXmacs is a text editing platform which is specialized for
scientists.  It is ideal for editing structured documents with
different types of content.  It has robust support for mathematical
formulas and plots.  It can also act as an interface to external
mathematical programs such as R and Octave.  TeXmacs is completely
