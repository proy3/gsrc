DESCRIPTION = Remake files automatically
define BLURB
Make is a program that is used to control the production of
executables or other files from their source files.  The process is
controlled from a Makefile, in which the developer specifies how
each file is generated from its source.  It has powerful dependency
resolution and the ability to determine when files have to be
regenerated after their sources change.  GNU make offers many powerful
extensions over the standard utility.
