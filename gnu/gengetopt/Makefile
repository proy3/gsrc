GARNAME = gengetopt
GARVERSION = 2.22.6
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/
DESCRIPTION = Create parsers for command line options
define BLURB
GNU Gengetopt is a program to generate a C/C++ function for parsing
command-line options using the getopt_long function found in GNU
libc, removing some of the tedium of this task for large programs
that accept many options.  The options parsed by the generated
function may be in both short (e.g., "-h") and long ("--help")
formats, as specified by the GNU coding standards.  Additionally, the
output of the standard options "--help" and "--version" is generated
automatically.
