NAME = ID Utils
GARNAME = idutils

DESCRIPTION = Identifier database utilities
define BLURB
The GNU idutils package includes tools to create an index of
textual tokens used in a list of file names and then to query that
index.  Thus, it allows the user to, for example, find all the uses of
a particular function in a large programming project.  In addition to
handling textual tokens, it can also handle numeric constants and the
contents of character strings.
