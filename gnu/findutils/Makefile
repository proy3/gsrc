GARVERSION = 4.4.2

DESCRIPTION = Operating on files matching given criteria
define BLURB
Findutils supplies the basic file directory searching utilities of
the GNU system.  It consists of two primary searching utilities:
"find" recursively searches for files in a directory according to
given criteria and "locate" lists files in a database that match a
query.  Two auxiliary tools are included: "updatedb" updates the file
name database and "xargs" may be used to apply commands with arbitrarily
long arguments.
