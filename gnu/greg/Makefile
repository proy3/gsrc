DESCRIPTION = Software testing framework
define BLURB
GNU Greg is a framework for testing programs and libraries.  It provides
a single front-end for all tests of a package as well as a simple
framework for writing the tests.  It is loaded as a Guile module into
any software with an embedded Guile interpreter.  It also provides a
compiled module that may be dynamically linked into Guile to permit
testing external programs.
