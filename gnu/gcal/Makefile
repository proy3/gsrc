DESCRIPTION = Calculating and printing a wide variety of calendars
define BLURB
Gcal is a program to calculate and print calendars on the
command-line.  Calendars can be printed in 1-month, 3-month or whole-year
views. In addition, eternal holiday lists can be generated for many
countries, which can be complemented by user-made lists of fixed
dates to make an agenda.  Gcal can also calculate astronomical data,
such as the phases of the moon, and supports alternative calendar
formats: Julian, Gregorian, Islamic, Chinese and more.
