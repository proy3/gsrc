GNU Dico implements a flexible dictionary server and client according
to RFC 2229 (DICT Server).  It is able to access any database
available, regardless of format, thanks to its modular structure.
New modules may be written in C, Guile or Python.  Dico also includes
a command-line client, which may be used to query remote dictionary
databases.
