DESCRIPTION = Library to extract meta-data from media files
define BLURB
GNU libextractor is a library for extracting metadata from files.  It
supports a very large number of file formats, including audio files,
document files, and archive files.  Each file format is implemented
as a plugin, so new formats can be added easily.  The package also
contains a command-line tool to extract metadata from a file and
print the results.
