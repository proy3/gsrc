DESCRIPTION = Stream editor
define BLURB
Sed is a non-interactive, text stream editor.  It receives a text
input from a file or from standard input and it then applies a series
of text editing commands to the stream and prints its output to
standard output.  It is often used for substituting text patterns in
a stream.  The GNU implementation offers several extensions over the
standard utility.
