NAME = Readline
GARNAME = readline
GARVERSION = 6.3
PATCHNUM = 006
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/readline/
DESCRIPTION = Edit command lines while typing, with history support
define BLURB
The GNU readline library allows users to edit command lines as they
are typed in.  It can maintain a searchable history of previously
entered commands, letting you easily recall, edit and re-enter past
commands.  It features both Emacs-like and vi-like keybindings,
making its usage comfortable for anyone.
