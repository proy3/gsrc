DESCRIPTION = Print lines matching a pattern
define BLURB
grep is a tool for finding text inside files.  Text is found by
matching a pattern provided by the user in one or many files.  The
pattern may be provided as a basic or extended regular expression, or
as fixed strings.  By default, the matching text is simply printed to
the screen, however the output can be greatly customized to include,
for example, line numbers.  GNU grep offers many extensions over the
standard utility, including, for example, recursive directory
searching.
