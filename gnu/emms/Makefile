DESCRIPTION = Emacs Multimedia System
define BLURB
EMMS is the Emacs Multimedia System.  It is a small front-end which
can control one of the supported external players.  Thus, it supports
whatever formats are supported by your music player.  It also
supports tagging and playlist management, all behind a clean and
light user interface.
