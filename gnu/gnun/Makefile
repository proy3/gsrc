DESCRIPTION = Build system for www.gnu.org translations
define BLURB
GNUnited Nations is a build system for translating the web site at
www.gnu.org.  It works via template files, which allow changes to be
merged into individual translations of a page, from which the final
HTML is generated.  In effect, this helps to keep all translations of
a page up-to-date.
