DESCRIPTION = Manage cpio and tar file archives
define BLURB
GNU cpio copies files into or out of cpio or tar archives.
Indeed, many formats are supported, including legacy formats.  The
format is determined automatically by the program and is handled
appropriately.  Furthermore, the location of the archive is not
important.  It can be another file on the drive, a tape, or data on a
pipe.
