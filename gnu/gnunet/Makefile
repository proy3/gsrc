DESCRIPTION = Anonymous peer-to-peer file-sharing framework
define BLURB
GNUnet is a framework for secure, peer-to-peer networking.  It works
in a decentralized manner and does not rely on any notion of trusted
services.  One service implemented on it is censorship-resistant
file-sharing.  Communication is encrypted and anonymity is provided
by making messages originating from a peer indistinguishable from
those that the peer is routing.  The package includes gnunet-gtk,
which provides a GTK+ graphical user interface to the GNUnet
service.
