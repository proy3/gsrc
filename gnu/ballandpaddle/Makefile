NAME = Ball and Paddle
GARNAME = ballandpaddle
GARVERSION = 0.8.1
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/ballandpaddle/
DESCRIPTION = Ball and paddle game extensible with Guile
define BLURB
Ball and Paddle is a classic arcade game in which you use a paddle at
the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball against bricks in the upper
region, eliminating the bricks as they are hit.  As a novel twist,
events and attributes of all the objects (bricks, ball, etc.) may be
scripted with GNU Guile.
