DESCRIPTION = Run jobs at scheduled times
define BLURB
GNU Mcron is a complete replacement for Vixie cron.  It is used to run
tasks on a schedule, such as every hour or every Monday.  Mcron is
written in Guile, so its configuration can be written in Scheme;
the original cron format is also supported.
