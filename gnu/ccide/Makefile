DESCRIPTION = Decision table code generator
define BLURB
GNU Ccide is a decision table code generator for the C language.  This
helps to avoid unmanageable and error-prone chains of nested if-else
statements.  Instead, decision tables are entered in an intuitive and
easy-to-read format, which is then expanded into portable C code.
