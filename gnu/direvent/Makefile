DESCRIPTION = Daemon to monitor directories for events such as file removal
define BLURB
A daemon that monitors directories for events, such as creating,
deleting or modifying files.  It can monitor different sets of
directories for different events.  When an event is detected, direvent
calls a specified external program with information about the event,
such as the location within the file system where it occurred.  Thus,
"direvent" provides an easy way to react immediately if given files
undergo changes, for example, to track changes in important system
configuration files.
