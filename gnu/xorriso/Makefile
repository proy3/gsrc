GNU Xorriso is a tool for copying files to and from ISO 9660 Rock
Ridge, a.k.a. Compact Disc File System, filesystems and it allows
session-wise manipulation of them.  It features a formatter and burner
for CD, DVD and BD.  It can operate on existing ISO images or it can
create new ones.  xorriso can then be used to copy files directly into
or out of ISO files.
