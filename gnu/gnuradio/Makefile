NAME = GNU Radio

GARVERSION = 3.7.3
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuradio
DESCRIPTION = Software radio implementations
define BLURB
GNU Radio is a toolkit for implementing software radios.  Its signal
processing blocks can be combined with low-cost external RF hardware
to create software-defined radios.  Without hardware, it can be used
for simulation.  Radio applications are primarily written in Python,
with C++ support for performance-critical processing tasks.
