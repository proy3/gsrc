DESCRIPTION = 3d Rubik's cube game
define BLURB
GNUbik is a puzzle game in which you must manipulate a cube to make
each of its faces have a uniform color.  The game is customizable,
allowing you to set the size of the cube (the default is 3x3) or to
change the colors.  You may even apply photos to the faces instead of
colors.  The game is scriptable with Guile.
