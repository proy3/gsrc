DESCRIPTION = A parameterized-text-generator generator based on a template
define BLURB
GNU Gengen is a program to generate text-generators, i.e., functions
producing text with variable sections.  The text is first specified
by the user in a template file containing parameters, then processed by
gengen to create the text-generator.  At runtime, the variable text is
defined by the rest of the program and passed to the text-generator,
which then substitutes it into the template parameters and returns the
result.  Gengen can be used to generate C and C++ code.
