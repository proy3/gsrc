DESCRIPTION = Support interactive 3d virtual environments
define BLURB
GNU MAVERIK is a development toolkit that supports 3D virtual
environments and interaction with those environments.  It sits on top
of a low-level rendering engine that uses OpenGL or Mesa, and
provides mechanisms to render different kinds of objects, to manage
environments and to provide support for 3D interaction.
