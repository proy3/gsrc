DESCRIPTION = The GNU documentation format
define BLURB
Texinfo is the official documentation format of the GNU project.  It
uses a single source file using explicit commands to
produce a final document in any of several supported output formats,
such as HTML or PDF.  This package includes both the tools necessary
to produce Info documents from their source and the
command-line Info reader.  The emphasis of the language is on
expressing the content semantically, avoiding physical markup commands.
