DESCRIPTION = Object-oriented component-based development environment
define BLURB
GNU EDMA is a development environment that combines ideas from both
object-oriented programming and component-based systems.  It is used
to build modular, evolving applications as well as reusable
components.  EDMA provides a convenient means to build
object-oriented programs in C without requiring C++.
Also, it has a unique component system, unlike other free software
component-based systems which imitate the design of proprietary
counterparts.  It includes a graphical wizard, gidfwizard,
a tool for building GNU EDMA Interface
definition files and to create skeleton files necessary to build
EDMA classes, and a graphical class browser, gecb.
