DESCRIPTION = Arbitrary precision numeric processing language

bc is an arbitrary precision numeric processing language.  It
includes an interactive environment for evaluating mathematical
statements.  Its syntax is similar to that of C, so basic usage is
familiar.  It also includes "dc", a reverse-polish calculator.
