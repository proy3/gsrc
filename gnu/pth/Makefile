NAME = Pth
GARNAME = pth
GARVERSION = 2.0.7
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/
DESCRIPTION = Portable thread library
define BLURB
GNU Pth is a portable library providing non-preemptive, priority-based
scheduling for multiple execution threads.  Each thread has its own
program-counter, run-time stack, signal mask and errno variable.
Threads are scheduled in a cooperative way, rather than in the
standard preemptive way, such that they are managed according to
priority and events.  However, Pth also features emulation of
POSIX.1c threads ("pthreads") for backwards compatibility.
