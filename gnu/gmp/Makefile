DESCRIPTION = Multiple-precision arithmetic library
define BLURB
GMP is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on
signed integers, rational numbers and floating point numbers.  The
precision is only limited by the available memory.  The library is
highly optimized, with a design focus on execution speed.  It is
aimed at use in, for example, cryptography and computational algebra.
