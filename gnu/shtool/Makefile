DESCRIPTION = Compilation of utility shell scripts into a shell tool
define BLURB
GNU shtool is a multipurpose shell tool.  It can perform the
functions of many different commands, in order to provide a single
tool to distribute with a source distribution in order to ensure
portability of shell scripts.  For example, shtool can perform the
jobs of the common commands "install", "mkdir" or "echo" on systems
that lack them.
