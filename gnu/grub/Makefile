DESCRIPTION = GRand Unified Boot loader
define BLURB
GRUB is a multiboot bootloader.  It is used for initially loading
the kernel of an operating system and then transferring control to
it. The kernel then goes on to load the rest of the operating system.
As a multiboot bootloader, GRUB handles the presence of multiple
operating systems installed on the same computer; upon booting the
computer, the user is presented with a menu to select one of the
installed operating systems.
