NAME = vc-dwim
GARNAME = vc-dwim
GARVERSION = 1.7
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/vc-dwim/
DESCRIPTION = Version-control-agnostic ChangeLog diff and commit tool
define BLURB
The vc-dwim package contains two tools, "vc-dwim" and "vc-chlog".
vc-dwim is a tool that simplifies the task of maintaining a ChangeLog
and using version control at the same time, for example by printing
a reminder when a file change has been described in the ChangeLog but
the file has not been added to the VC.  vc-chlog scans changed files
and generates standards-compliant ChangeLog entries based on the
changes that it detects.
