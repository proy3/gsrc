DESCRIPTION = Paginator for terminals
define BLURB
GNU less is a pager, a program that allows you to view large amounts
of text in page-sized chunks.  Unlike traditional pagers, it allows
both backwards and forwards movement through the document.  It also
does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so it
starts faster than most text editors.
