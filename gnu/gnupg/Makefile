DESCRIPTION = GNU Privacy Guard
define BLURB
The GNU Privacy Guard is a complete implementation of the OpenPGP
standard.  It is used to encrypt and sign data and communication.  It
features powerful key management and the ability to access public key
servers.  It includes several libraries: libassuan (IPC between GnuPG
components), libgpg-error (centralized GnuPG error values), and libskba
(working with X.509 certificates and CMS data).
