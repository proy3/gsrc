DESCRIPTION = Translating web service in BPEL to Open Workflow Nets
define BLURB
GNU BPEL2oWFN translates a web service expressed in Web Service Business
Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL) into an open Workflow Net
(oWFN).  It may additionally convert a BPEL4Chor choreography to a
Petri Net model.  Properties of Petri Nets may be analyzed
efficiently, due to the use of static analysis to make the models
compact.  Control and data flow analysis, as well as basic checks for
deadlocks and other such properties are available.
