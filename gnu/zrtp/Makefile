# CMake seems to ignore most environment variables. In this case, 
# libzrtp requires OpenSSL 0.98, which GSRC does not provide, but 
# since CMake does not seem to honor the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable
# and since GSRC tries to use its own pkg-build by default, it cannot
# find the library. Here we remove the argument to use GSRC's pkg-config
# so that the thing will at least build.
