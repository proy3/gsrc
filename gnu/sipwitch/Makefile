GARVERSION = 1.9.2
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/sipwitch/
DESCRIPTION = Secure peer-to-peer VoIP server for the SIP protocol
define BLURB
GNU SIP Witch is a peer-to-peer Voice-over-IP server that uses the
SIP protocol.  Calls can be made from behind NAT firewalls and
without the need for a service provider.  Its peer-to-peer design
ensures that there is no central point for media intercept or capture
and thus it can be used to construct a secure telephone system that
operates over the public internet.
