DESCRIPTION = Visualizing and demonstrating convolution
define BLURB
GNU C-Graph is a tool for demonstrating the theory of convolution.  Thus,
it can serve as an excellent aid to students of signal and systems
theory in visualizing the convolution process.  Rather than forcing
the student to write code, the program offers an intuitive interface
with interactive dialogs to guide them.
