NAME = Compact Disc Input and Control Library
GARNAME = libcdio
GARVERSION = 0.92
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/
DESCRIPTION = CD Input and Control library
define BLURB
The GNU Compact Disc Input and Control Library (libcdio) is a library
for CD-ROM and CD image file access.  It allows the developer to add
CD access to an application without having to worry about the OS- and
device-dependent properties of CD-ROM or the specific details of CD
image formats.  It includes pycdio, a Python interface to libcdio, and
libcdio-paranoia, a library providing jitter-free and
error-free audio extraction from CDs.
