NAME = M4
GARNAME = m4
GARVERSION = 1.4.17
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/
DESCRIPTION = Macro processor
define BLURB
GNU M4 is an implementation of the M4 macro language, which features
some extensions over other implementations, some of which are
required by GNU Autoconf.  It is used as a macro processor, which
means it processes text, expanding macros as it encounters them.  It
also has some built-in functions, for example to run shell commands
or to do arithmetic.
