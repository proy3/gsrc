GNU libmatheval is a library to parse and evaluate symbolic
expressions input by the user as text.  It can be loaded from both C

variables of arbitrary names, decimal and symbolic constants, basic
unary and binary operators, and elementary mathematical functions.
It can also compute symbolic derivatives and output expressions to
strings.
