# This is a sample script for setting up your system's environment to
# use the software installed by GSRC. You may customize this as you 
# wish. Note that in these examples, the software installed by GSRC
# is found before other software. Thus, if you install a package that
# is already installed via your package manager or otherwise, the GSRC
# package will be used.
#
# To use this script, do not run it directly. Instead, you must use
# the `source' command as follows:
#
# $ source setup.sh

# This is the location where GSRC packages are installed
GSRC=@prefix@

# PATH gives the locations of executable files (program binary files).

# LD_LIBRARY_PATH gives the locations of shared library files. Note

# system's package manager, there may be unexpected behavior due to
# version conflicts.
