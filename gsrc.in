# This is a convenience script primarily aimed at facilitating the
# discovery of GSRC packages.  Thus, there are functions for searching
# by keyword(s), displaying information on a package, and then getting
# the path to the package so you can easily install it, view its
# source code, etc.  This script is rather simple, so it is
# straight-forward to extend it by wrapping more GSRC functionality
# with it.  Put this script somewhere in your PATH so you can access
# GSRC from any directory!

Usage: gsrc [info|path|search] [PACKAGE|TERMS]
Discover info about GSRC packages
    
  info        display info about PACKAGE
  path        display the path to PACKAGE
  search      search for packages relevant to TERMS
    
PACKAGE names may be passed with or without their project dirname (i.e.
both 'gnu/hello' and 'hello' are fine). 

Searches are performed using extended regular expressions. See the 
'grep' documentation for more information. A list of packages matching 
any of the TERMS will be displayed.
