The install process for GSRC is fairly straight forward.
Extract/check-out the files into the desired directory, and run the
commands

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure

You can give `./configure' the normal GNU configure arguments.  If you
decide to change these, either reconfigure, or edit `config.mk'.

After you have done that, you can use GSRC to install packages.  For
further instruction, run the command

$ make help

If you are curious about what is created in each of these steps:
 ./bootstrap:
    * aclocal.m4
    * autom4te.cache/
    * configure
    * doc/Makefile.in
    * doc/mdate-sh
    * doc/texinfo.tex
    * GNUmakefile.in
    * install-sh
    * missing
 ./configure:
    * config.log
    * config.mk
    * config.status
    * doc/Makefile
    * GNUmakefile
